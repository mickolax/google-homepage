Project Started: 21.8.2020

Goal:
Recreate the Google homepage look-wise, not functionally.

Required skills:
- Basic HTML
- Basic CSS
- Using Git


COMMENTS AFTER "COMPLETION":

- Not super happy with the result.
- Maybe I tried to go too complicated with the DOM? 
- Couldn't get the bottom nav work for some reason:
	- The position should be always at the bottom ragardless of the viewport size.
	- All the links should be on the same row. I could not get the flexbox working there and instead they insisted on going on separate rows instead of next to eachother.
- My CSS becomes total spaghetti after all those fix attempts. Probably a lot of unnecessary rows there. Too tired to go through.
- Good enough for this exercise I guess.
